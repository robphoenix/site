Maybe because I'm such a late arrival to this programming pastime, I feel a certain inadequacy, a need to over compensate.  Or maybe I just find it exciting learning new things, and I just want to get deeper and consume everything.  Anyway, I've been getting more interested in functional programming, I don't know why.  I'm not so embedded in object-oriented, and I've been trying to understand JavaScript's prototype-based programming, and if I'm honest, these concepts aren't yet meaningful enough to me to matter so much outside of syntax and the practicalities of how to write code, yet functional programming seems to make a certain amount of sense. Perhaps this will become an endeavour in proving myself wrong. So, I listened to [Carin Meier][cm] on [The Changelog][cl] and bought [her book][lc], and am going to start learning Clojure.

[Leiningen][lngen] is the tool Carin recommends for getting started with Clojure, so let's install that.
Check Java is installed first:

```bash
$ java -version
java version "1.7.0_80"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_80-b15)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.80-b11, mixed mode)
```

Initially I used my package manager to install Leiningen, but this installed an old version.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get leiningen
$ lein -v
Leiningen 1.7.1 on Java 1.7.0_80 Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM
```

So, I uninstalled that, and followed the instructions on the Leiningen site.  Copy and Paste the contents of the [lein][lein] file, into a file called `lein`.  Move the file into my `$PATH`, and make it executable.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get remove leiningen # remove apt-get installed lein
$ vim ~/lein # copy and paste the contents of the lein file
$ echo $PATH # check path
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games
:/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/bin:/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/db/bin:/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-or
acle/jre/bin:/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/bin:/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/db/bin:/usr/lib/j
vm/java-7-oracle/jre/bin
$ mv ~/lein /usr/bin/lein # move the lein file into my $PATH
$ chmod a+x /usr/bin/lein # make it executable
$ lein # aaaaaand run it!

repl                Start a repl session either with the current project or standalone.
retest              Run only the test namespaces which failed last time around.
run                 Run a -main function with optional command-line arguments.

show-profiles       List all available profiles or display one if given an argument.
test                Run the project's tests.
trampoline          Run a task without nesting the project's JVM inside Leiningen's.
uberjar             Package up the project files and dependencies into a jar file.

Run `lein help $TASK` for details.

Global Options:
  -o             Run a task offline.
  -U             Run a task after forcing update of snapshots.
  -h, --help     Print this help or help for a specific task.
  -v, --version  Print Leiningen's version.

mixed-source, templates, and copying.

$
$ lein -v # check the version again, 2.5.2 > 1.7.1, super.
Leiningen 2.5.2 on Java 1.7.0_80 Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM
$
$ lein repl # Fire up the REPL, first time this did some more stuff, see below
            # but subsequent times it didn't, no worries.

So the following is basically just me following along with Carin's book, where she starts to introduce Clojure.  So all credit goes to her, I'm just a messenger.

```bash
$ lein new wonderland # start a new Clojure project
Generating a project called wonderland based on the 'default' template.
The default template is intended for library projects, not applications.
To see other templates (app, plugin, etc), try `lein help new`.
$ cd wonderland/ # change into it
/wonderland$ lein repl # and get the REPL going again

```

That's as far as I got last night. I know it's not far, but having kids makes me tired.  And I just want to reiterate again, this is basically just regurgitating Carin's work, go [buy her book][lc].

Interestingly, the name *Leiningen* comes from the short story [Leiningen versus the Ants][story].  A tale of plantation owner Leiningen's battle against an invading army of flesh-eating ants.  It's a really good read, triumph over adversity, the importance of intelligence and resourcefulness, I highly recommend you [read][story] it.
