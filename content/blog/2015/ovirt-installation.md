Installing [oVirt][1], the upstream project of  [Red Hat's Enterprise Virtualization][2] product, and [vSphere][3] alternative.

I started this install on Fedora, using the latest release, 21, ignoring the oVirt website where it said *"Important: It is recommended that you install oVirt on Fedora 20"*, assuming the latest is the greatest, only to find that oVirt is not available on Fedora 21.  This was the first bump on a rocky road.  I did start off installing on Fedora 20 but ended up using CentOS 7 instead.  If you're interested in using Fedora 20, you can download it [here][4] or [here][5].

The main issue I found was DNS; resolving the server's hostname.  I'm doing this on a private lab network, and haven't got round to setting up a DNS server yet, so I had to configure my hosts file and set up [dnsmasq][6]. From oVirt's troubleshooting page...

*"**When running engine-setup, I get the message "myhost.local did not resolve into an IP address", but setting up bind locally is hard. Is there an easy way to spoof full DNS locally?***
*The easiest solution is to use dnsmasq for DNS. You then use the IP address of your engine as your DNS server, and in /etc/dnsmasq.conf you point to your regular DNS servers with "server=8.8.8.8" (for example). You will also need to open port 53 in iptables to enable computers on your home network to use this DNS server. To do this, add the line "-A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m udp -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT" to your iptables configuration, remembering to add it also to any configuration files required to ensure that the option persists across reboots."*

First things first, after a minimal install of CentOS 7; update, reboot & install a few programs:
- net-tools for the ifconfig command
- vim as my text editor of choice
- bind-utils to check my DNS
- dnsmasq to set up my DNS


```bash
$ sudo yum update
$ sudo reboot
$ sudo yum -y install net-tools vim bind-utils dnsmasq
```

A quick check of the DNS shows the hostname is not resolving to my ip address:

```bash
$ host 10.0.0.5
Host 5.0.0.10.in-addr.arpa. not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)

$ host oVirt-01
oVirt-01.lab-test.local has address 127.0.53.53
oVirt-01.lab-test.local mail is handled by 10 your-dns-needs-immediate-attention.dev.
```

Configure hosts file:

```bash
# ==={ open up the hosts file }===
$ sudo vim /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
# ==={ add in server ip address & fqdn }===
10.0.0.5 oVirt-01.lab-test.local oVirt01
```

Configure dnsmasq:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl enable /usr/lib/systemd/system/dnsmasq.service
$ sudo systemctl start dnsmasq.service

# ==={ open up the dnsmasq.conf file }===
$ sudo vim /etc/dnsmasq.conf
# ==={ add in your DNS servers, here I'm just using Google's }===
server=8.8.8.8
server=8.8.4.4
# ==={ add in the listen-address for the localhost }===
listen-address=127.0.0.1
# ==={ open up the resolv.conf file }===
sudo vim /etc/resolv.conf
# ==={ add in the localhost address as your first nameserver }===
search lab-test.local
nameserver 127.0.0.1
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
# ==={ restart the dnsmasq service }===
$ sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq.service
```

Right, let's check our DNS again:

```bash
$ host 10.90.0.5
5.0.0.10.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer oVirt-01.lab-test.local.

$ host oVirt-01
oVirt-01.lab-test.local has address 10.0.0.5
oVirt-01.lab-test.local mail is handled by 10 your-dns-needs-immediate-attention.dev.
```

Excellent, success!

I have to admit that the next bit concerning firewall settings I don't fully understand, it has been added to my *'Things to research and understand'* list.  But, this is what I did so I'll add it here.  For those more knowledgeable than myself, please feel free to enlighten/correct me.

```bash
# ==={ this stops the firewalld service to use iptables instead }===
$ sudo systemctl mask firewalld.service
$ sudo systemctl stop firewalld
$ sudo yum install iptables-services
$ systemctl enable iptables
$ systemctl start iptables

# ==={ a quick check of iptables }===
$ sudo iptables -L
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

# ==={ add in the iptables line suggested by oVirt }===
$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m udp -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT
# ==={ and check iptables again }===
$ sudo iptables -L
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
ACCEPT     udp  --  anywhere             anywhere             state NEW udp dpt:domain

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

# ==={ save the iptables configuration }===
$ sudo iptables-save
# Generated by iptables-save v1.4.21 on Thu Apr  9 16:58:37 2015
*filter
:INPUT ACCEPT [102:8210]
:FORWARD ACCEPT [0:0]
:OUTPUT ACCEPT [22:3728]
-A INPUT -p udp -m state --state NEW -m udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT
COMMIT
# Completed on Thu Apr  9 16:58:37 2015
```

Again I don't fully understand the next configuration concerning Network Manager.  I was aware of it reading Jason Brooks [excellent oVirt documentation][7] but not knowing why it was done, I actually didn't do it initially.  My oVirt setup failed and so I added it in and the setup worked, so it obviously does something! *(Yep, added to the **'Things to research and understand'** list!)*


```bash
$ sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager.service
$ sudo systemctl mask NetworkManager.service
ln -s '/dev/null' '/etc/systemd/system/NetworkManager.service'
$ sudo service network start
Starting network (via systemctl):                                                       [  OK  ]
$ sudo chkconfig network on
```

And on to installing oVirt.  By the way, I'm just installing the All-in-One, on a single server, and pretty much accepting all the defaults.

```bash
$ sudo yum localinstall http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release35.rpm

$ sudo yum install -y ovirt-engine-setup-plugin-allinone

$ sudo engine-setup
