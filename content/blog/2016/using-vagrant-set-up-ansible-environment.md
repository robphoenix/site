Vagrant is a tool for creating, managing and sharing Virtual Machines. It's
really helpful for creating contained environments with specific requirements
that can be easily built up, tore down and shared with others. It's especially
helpful if, like me, you have to spend time working on a Windows laptop, because,
well, Enterprise.

Following on from my [previous post](https://bordeltabernacle.github.io/2016/08/01/starting-out-with-ansible-cisco-and-network-automation.html),
I've found that Vagrant is a fairly painless way to expose the network engineers
I work with to Ansible. Once it's installed, I can share a zip file for them to
unzip and run `vagrant up` and `vagrant ssh` from the command line, and they're
in a working Ansible environment. And if they mess something up, they can just
destroy it and start again, no bother.

Vagrant manages VM's through a hypervisor, with the default being Virtualbox,
though you can use VMware if you have the extra cash. Therefore we need to
install Virtualbox first, from [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
We're going ot grab the Windows `.exe` file. Double click on it, and follow
the defaults through to the end.

Now we can install Vagrant, from [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html),
grabbing the Windows `.msi` file, double clicking on it once it's downloaded and
following the defaults.

Vagrant is a command line tool, so you're gonna have to be comfortable on the
command line, not too much, just enough to know what it is, how to access it
and how to navigate the directory structure, whether it's through `cmd.exe` or
Powershell. I'm not going to go into any of that here, but I would recommend
getting [cmder](http://cmder.net/) if you're going to spend any sort of time
on the Windows command line.

So, at your command prompt, if all has been successful you should be able to
type `vagrant --version` and get the version of vagrant you have installed:

```
Vagrant 1.8.4
```

Grand. The beauty of Vagrant is that it's configured from a simple text file,
the _Vagrantfile_. To create one, start a new directory, and then, on the
command line, navigate to within this new directory and type `vagrant init`.
This will create a new, highly commented _Vagrantfile_. Read it, and get an
idea of what the different options are. Like most things, you often start with
a bare bones structure like this basic _Vagrantfile_, and build it up as you
learn more and your requirements change. Here I'm going to explain the Vagrantfile
I use to set up my Ansible machine.

```ruby
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

vagrant_root = File.dirname(__FILE__)
project_name = "acp"

Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
    config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"
    config.vm.box_url = "https://atlas.hashicorp.com/ubuntu/boxes/trusty64"
    config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
        vb.memory = "1028"
        vb.cpus = "1"
    end

    config.vm.define "#{project_name}" do |machine|
        machine.vm.hostname = "#{project_name}"
        machine.vm.synced_folder "#{vagrant_root}/shared", "/home/vagrant/shared"
        machine.vm.provision :shell, :path => "#{vagrant_root}/ansible-setup.sh"
    end
end
```

Vagrant is written in Ruby, and the first two lines are to do with the Ruby language. Next up we have a couple of variables:

```ruby
vagrant_root = File.dirname(__FILE__)
project_name = "acp"
```

- `vagrant_root` is the current working directory of the Vagrantfile
- `project_name` is the name of the project, here it is `acp` for Ansible Cisco Playground.

The next section of the _Vagrantfile_ starts the machine configuration:

```ruby
config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"
config.vm.box_url = "https://atlas.hashicorp.com/ubuntu/boxes/trusty64"
config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    vb.memory = "1028"
    vb.cpus = "1"
```

- `config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"` defines the base operating system, or Vagrant _box_, for the VM, here we're using the official Ubuntu 14.04 Server image, but this can be changed to any one of a multitude of Vagrant _boxes_, that can be found [here](https://vagrantcloud.com/boxes/search)
- `config.vm.box_url = "https://atlas.hashicorp.com/ubuntu/boxes/trusty64"` is the url where this box is
- `config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|` this says that if the `provider`, the hypervisor, is Virtualbox, do the following
- `vb.memory = "1028"` gives the VM 1 GB of RAM
- `vb.cpus = "1"` gives the VM 1 CPU

The last section is where it gets interesting...

```ruby
config.vm.define "#{project_name}" do |machine|
    machine.vm.hostname = "#{project_name}"
    machine.vm.synced_folder "#{vagrant_root}/shared", "/home/vagrant/shared"
    machine.vm.provision :shell, :path => "#{vagrant_root}/ansible-setup.sh"
end
```

- `config.vm.define "#{project_name}" do |machine|` here we start to define some parameters for the machine
- `machine.vm.hostname = "#{project_name}"` defines the hostname of the machine as the project name
- `machine.vm.synced_folder "#{vagrant_root}/shared", "/home/vagrant/shared"`
  this sets up a shared folder between the VM and the host computer, my laptop.
  `"#{vagrant_root}/shared"` is a folder on the host, within the same directory
  as the _Vagrantfile_, `"/home/vagrant/shared"` is a folder in the vagrant user's
  home directory on the VM. These folders will be synced, any changes made in one
  will be reflected in the other. This means I can edit and version control files
  on my host machine, using my usual workflow, and I can use them easily in the VM,
  rather than having to do this work inside the VM.
- `machine.vm.provision :shell, :path => "#{vagrant_root}/ansible-setup.sh"`
  this defines the path to a shell script that provisions the VM, installing Ansible.
  There are different options for provisioning the Vm, including Ansible itself,
  woah, meta! but I find for small environments like this a shell script does fine.

This is the `ansible-setup.sh` file:

```bash

echo "|                Go build stuff!               |"
echo "+----------------------------------------------+"
```

There's a few things going on in there, including the Ansible installation and
the installation of [Jason Edelman's](http://jedelman.com/) excellent third
party Ansible library [ntc-ansible](https://github.com/networktocode/ntc-ansible/)

Now, if we do a `tree /F` command in the project directory, we can see everything
we now have, the _Vagrantfile_, the provision script, the shared folder
(currently empty), and a `.vagrant` directory I've never had to do anything with
since working with Vagrant.

```

Right, we're ready to go. I've found the vagrant commands I use most often are...

- `vagrant up` brings the machine up
- `vagrant ssh` establishes an ssh connection to the VM
- `vagrant halt` shuts the VM down
- `vagrant reload` restarts the VM
- `vagrant destroy` destroys the VM

On the command line, inside the Vagrant project directory, type in `vagrant up`,
and this should, fingers crossed, bring up the new VM. If this is the first
Vagrant machine you've created it's going to take some time to download the
Ubuntu image, 15-20 mins maybe. I already have the relevant Ubuntu image, so it
only takes ~60 secs to bring the VM up. This is the output I get...

```bash

    acp: shared folder errors, please make sure the guest additions within the
    acp: virtual machine match the version of VirtualBox you have installed on
    acp: your host and reload your VM.

==> acp: +----------------------------------------------+
```

The bottom part is the provision script, this will only run the first time the
machine is started. Otherwise the output will be:

```bash
==> acp: Machine already provisioned. Run `vagrant provision` or use the `--provision`
==> acp: flag to force provisioning. Provisioners marked to run always will still run.
```

It will also be a lot quicker bringing the machine up, a few seconds maybe. So
much quicker than dealing with Virtualbox manually.

We can check the status of the machine with `vagrant status`...

```bash
Current machine states:

acp                       running (virtualbox)

The VM is running. To stop this VM, you can run `vagrant halt` to
shut it down forcefully, or you can run `vagrant suspend` to simply
suspend the virtual machine. In either case, to restart it again,
simply run `vagrant up`.
```

And so now that we have a running VM, we need to access it. For this we use the
`vagrant ssh` command, which will bring us into the VM's command line...

vagrant@acp:~$
```

Let's check Ansible is there...

```bash
vagrant@acp:~$ ansible --version
ansible 2.1.1.0
  config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
vagrant@acp:~$
```

Fantastic! Let's check we've got a network to the outside world...

```bash
vagrant@acp:~$ ping 8.8.8.8
PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.

```

Sweet. And is our shared folder there...

```bash
vagrant@acp:~$ ls -l
total 8
drwxr-xr-x 6 root    root    4096 Aug  3 09:55 ntc-ansible
drwxrwxrwx 1 vagrant vagrant 4096 Aug  3 09:56 shared
```

There it is, alongside the `ntc-ansible` module. If we create a file in there,
we should see it on our host machine.

```bash
vagrant@acp:~$ echo "Hello Windows, from Linux" > shared/hello.txt
vagrant@acp:~$ ls -l shared/
total 1
-rwxrwxrwx 1 vagrant vagrant 26 Aug  3 10:17 hello.txt
```

![hello_msg](../../assets/hello_msg.png)

Good good, we can now start creating our Ansible files on our host machine, and
easily run them in the Vagrant VM. And when we need to share what we've done,
we can just zip up the directory, or version control it in git, share it, and
others can `vagrant up` and `vagrant ssh` into the working environment we've created.

This Ansible Cisco Playground directory is up on Github if you want to clone/download
it and have a play. It is a work in progress, and a little janky currently,
with no documentation, but [here it is nonetheless](https://github.com/bordeltabernacle/ansible_cisco_playground).
