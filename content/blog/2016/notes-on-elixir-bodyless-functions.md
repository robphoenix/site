```elixir
def func(argument)
# NOTHING TO SEE HERE
```

A function head without a body clause? What's the point in that, huh?

The bodyless function clause is something I've only come across recently, one of
those things that I think I probably read about at some point but didn't
register until I [submitted a pull request][pr]. I've not been able to find out
much about them, but here's a quick rundown of when you might see a bodyless
function clause.

EDIT(14/01/16): I've added *Protocols*.

As far as I know, the bodyless function clause is only something used within
Elixir & Erlang, and possibly Prolog. The [Erlang docs][ed] give an interesting
explanation of what happens when a function is called.  This explanation hints
at the separation of the head and body of functions and I believe applies to
Elixir as well.

This explanation breaks functions up into the head and body, where the head *"consists
of the function name, an argument list, and an optional guard sequence beginning
with the keyword when"*, and the body *"consists of a sequence of expressions"*.

When a function is called, the function code is located, and the function clauses
are checked in turn to find one where *"the patterns in the clause head can be
successfully matched against the given arguments"*, and *"the guard sequence, if
any, is true"*.  It's only if a function head corresponds to this
that the function body is then evaluated.  This gives the impression of the head
and body being separate entities, the head being a kind of control mechanism
that doesn't necessarily require a body.

So, what is this useful for?  The three reasons I know of for using a bodyless
function clause in Elixir are [documentation][doc], [default arguments][defargs]
and [protocols][protocols].

The Elixir compiler infers function argument names from the code. If the
argument name is not explicit, for instance in the case of a pattern match on a
data structure, this may sometimes result in something you don't want. If so, you
can use a bodyless function to define the name you want the argument to have,
the name that would be used in the function's documentation, using [ExDocs][exdoc] for example.

The compiler will infer the argument name for [this function][hd] as `hash_dict`;

```elixir
def size(%HashDict{size: size}) do
  size
end
```

If we would rather it was `dict` we could add in an extra function head:

```elixir
def size(dict)

def size(%HashDict{size: size}) do
  size
end
```

If you are including default arguments for a function with multiple clauses you
have to declare them in a separate function head:

```elixir
defmodule Lorem do
  def ipsum(size, type \\ :paragraph, style \\ :lorem_ipsum)

  def ipsum(size, :paragraph, style), do: ...
  def ipsum(size, :sentence, style), do: ...
  def ipsum(size, :word, style), do: ...
end
```

In this very basic example there are 3 function clauses that have a body, and
one bodyless function that defines the defult arguments for these function
clauses.

My knowledge of protocols is very limited, so I'm going to leave a deeper
explanation of them to a later post. What I do know is that a protocol is
defined with a bodyless function, like so:

```elixir
defprotocol Valid do
  @doc "Returns true if data is considered nominally valid"
  def valid?(data)
end
```

A complete complete function with the same name is then expected, by the
protocol, for each data type you want to implement it for.  In this case, for
each data type you want to test for validity.

So, there you go, the function head, a mechanism in it's own right, separate from
the main function body.  If you know of any other uses of the bodyless function
please do let me know.
